# Titanic-RF-Kaggle

My first ever Kaggle competition entry and one of my first ML projects. 

I used a Random Forest algorithm as I felt like it was the right call. I did not perform cross-validation but online sources say that Random Forests is a good idea on this project.

My ranking is not very high as of now, but I have predicted more than 76% of survivors correctly so I'm proud of that.
